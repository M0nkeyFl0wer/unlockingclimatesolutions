                <p>Over the years, the number one question we've heard from people new to the crypto space through grant programs we have run or we have met through interviews for this research has been: What chain should I build on?</p>
                
                <p>In earlier iterations of this research site we remained neutral about promoting or even mentioning any one chain. It was really cool how the ethereum foundation team gave us the freedom to do this work in that way. But as we experienced years of running grant programs for clients in this space this same pattern repeated itself. It's harder to recruit, let alone maintain developers and build in any ecosystem unless its interoperable with the larger community and their financial markets and resources.</p>
                
                <p>It seems as of late there has been a refocusing of the Ethereum community around highlighting the benefits of building within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) world. This code base is the foundation of the vast majority of things most people think of as cryptocurrency and blockchain space. We have decided the best approach is to actually be helpful and encourage people to join the open source builder in the EVM.</p>
                
                <p>When you're just starting out, the last thing you want is to make a strategic mistake that limits your project before it ever really begins. And for more experienced developers, they might jump into an ecosystem because of a bounty or a grant opportunity but what seems to happen often is people leave.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- The Recruiting Challenge -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>The Recruiting Challenge</h2>
                
                <p>One of the hardest parts of our work in grant programs supporting emerging or established networks has been trying to recruit new builders into ecosystems that aren't EVM-compatible. Even when there's real innovation, we constantly ran into adoption friction trying to recruit good developers into grant programs and hackathons enticing people to build on alternative L1s. Even if some developers were willing to build for a bounty or grant, the lack of interoperability and composability made it harder for their work to plug into the wider ecosystem. And eventually they refactor their apps and their thinking and follow the majority or just leave inactive apps to wither for eternity on alternative L1s.</p>
                
                <p>Within the less decentralized networks there are interesting things being built but that often has more in common with the legacy web than the decentralized world Ethereum is central to. And that is totally fine, and could be great, its just not really a blockchain.</p>
                
                <p>We don't want to dismiss non-EVM ecosystems who are truly decentralized. Communities like Cosmos, for instance, are doing genuinely novel, and inspiring work. But even for many in that ecosystem their biggest frustration is often again frustration around adoption as the result of a lack of interoperability connecting back to Ethereum. It's also why we've seen entire chains switch over to being built as an L2 on Ethereum, like Celo. In practice, almost every chain either starts EVM or eventually has to make the move in some way.</p>
                
                <p>Which leads us to a simple truth: <strong>all roads lead back to Ethereum</strong>.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Why the EVM? -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why the EVM?</h2>
                
                <p>For people who are new, here are the most important reasons:</p>
                
                <h3>Community and Documentation</h3>
                <p>The EVM is where the builders are. It's the largest and most diverse developer community in the blockchain world, with more tutorials, tooling, and shared infrastructure than anywhere else. When you get stuck (and you will), having that community is everything.</p>
                
                <h3>Open Source and Decentralization</h3>
                <p>Ethereum was designed around an open-source design philosophy. Projects built here inherit that ethos composability, interoperability, and resistance to capture. Many other chains that advertise speed or ease of use are cutting corners in exactly the places that matter most: decentralization and censorship resistance.</p>
                
                <h3>Security, Speed, and Scale</h3>
                <p>Not every app needs Ethereum's base-layer security. That's where L2s and L3s come in scaling solutions that extend Ethereum without giving up the values that make it powerful. They let you balance security, speed, and cost without leaving the ecosystem.</p>

            <!-- The Trap of "Blockchain vs Bullshit" -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>The Trap of "Blockchain vs Bullshit"</h2>
                
                <p>One of the most useful frames we've encountered for thinking about how people actually use blockchains came from Andreas Antonopoulos in his talk Blockchain vs. Bullshit. He said: if you can do a "find-and-replace" in someone's whitepaper and swap out the word blockchain for "multiple copies of an excel spreadsheet" and the app would work the same, then you don't need a blockchain. The core features of a decentralized blockchain are immutability, censorship resistance and persistence. In other words, secure records that aren't under the control of governments or corporations. But not every app needs this security and independence.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>That framework stuck with us over the years. And yet, as we did our research we came to see the other side: for many people, building on Ethereum wasn't just about "needing a blockchain." It was about wanting a public ledger, a shared database not controlled by any one vendor or government. That choice to align with decentralization is itself strategic. Someone said to us, if I'm not going to put this important data in a decentralized ledger then tell me… which corporate database should I trust instead? Which ecosystem should I get locked into that is beyond my control?</p>
                
                <p>Contrast that with many so-called "Ethereum alternatives." Too often they're really just distributed databases, centrally governed. They may work fine for many things, but they aren't really blockchains in terms of their fundamental characteristics. They might as well be multiple copies of an excel spreadsheet. Because the trust of their data comes from trusting the people with the power instead of that power being distributed so widely that its mathematically trustworthy.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>
                
                <p>The stakes are higher than ever. Governments and corporations are openly experimenting with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other centralized ledgers. If we surrender decentralization, what we're left with is just another database but now with, a dystopian level of surveillance and loss of self control.</p>
                
                <p>Ethereum isn't perfect, nothing is, but its open source and people around the world are constantly working to make it better It is the most battle-tested base layer that is an alternative to the centralized, government and corporation controlled ledgers we have that is not only a form of money (like bitcoin) and now uses very little electricity. And now with low fees and fast transactions the Layer 2 or L2 and L3 ecosystem, built on top of Ethereum is making it more practical every day to build a wide range of applications that run directly on top of this global decentralized infrastructure.</p>
                
                <p>And for new builders, choosing the EVM is more than just a technical decision. It's choosing to align your project with the largest open-source community, the strongest set of values, and the best chance at long-term relevance. My experience has generally been that builders in this space are friendly and open minded and creative and more than anything else helpful and supportive. Open source building leaves a lot of room for win-win outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Closing</h2>
                
                <p>Lets be clear, if what you are building sucks, it doesn't matter where you build it. Garbage in, garbage out right? But if what you are building is cool and you are aligned with decentralized, open source building and low energy consumption, do yourself a favour and build in the Ethereum community.</p>
                
                <p>Yes, there are opportunities in newer ecosystems, especially those eager to drive adoption. But if they're not EVM-compatible, there's a real price to pay in adoption of friction and lost interoperability.</p>
                
                <p>Whether that's Ethereum, Base, zk sync, Optimism, Arbitrum, or another L2, you really can't go wrong.</p>
                
                <p>Because the overwhelming activity, innovation, and momentum of this space continues to flow through the EVM. And we believe we're still only at the beginning of what's going to be built on this foundation.</p>
                
                <p class="closing-quote">Everything else is just a database, and if not done right these tools can actually be really dangerous.</p>
