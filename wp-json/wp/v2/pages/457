There is also a focus on finding creative ways to leverage market forces to generate microeconomics that can potentially self-finance climate solutions and other public goods.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\"><span style=\"text-transform: none !important;\">Looking at the projects currently using blockchain technology for climate solutions, it is clear that those funding and coordinating \u201con the ground\u201d activities are having an impact already. This includes projects focused on using blockchain technology to help finance and coordinate solar and wind projects as well as some early explorations of local grid infrastructure with blockchain as its backbone. There are also projects making headway with location-based micro-loans or other crypto-enabled lending or decentralized financing.

Although the underlying values of the emerging Web3 social movement, which are focused on digital rights on the open web, are a powerful driving force in the kind of change we are discussing, for the sake of this report we will focus more narrowly on use cases that are directly enabled by blockchain technology. DAOs and their role in social change are topics worthy of additional research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\"><span style=\"text-transform: none !important;\">Different types of projects require different types of support in order to maximise their impact, for example; those projects with bigger potential outcomes but also more structural impediments such as the need for policy change.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\"><span style=\"text-transform: none !important;\">The largest obstacles and opportunities that we identified were government policies of various shapes and sizes as well as public perception. Not only are government policies and regulations being influenced by public perception but public perception is in turn, being influenced by government policy (or the lack thereof).

We do not need technological advancement to act today. The primary challenges are political and structural as opposed to a lack of adequate cost efficient alternatives to the status quo.
