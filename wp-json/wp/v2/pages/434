With The Use Of On-Site Equipment As Well As shared Satellite Data These Costs Can Be Dramatically Reduced. Standardization and open protocols could build international trust with all countries using the same open data structure. Ideally these costs savings, Especially as it relates to smaller scale voluntary offsets, could result in more funding going directly to the people on the ground reducing emissions by changing their agricultural and land stewardship practices.This Technology Can Also Be Very Helpful For removing the middle men &nbsp;in other ways such as deploying fair and Efficient Crop Insurance or Effectively Monitoring A Variety Of Agricultural Initiatives and directly compensating farmers based on observable activity.&nbsp;As is the case with many Blockchain enabled use cases there are of course other ways of doing the same things but they generally rely on trusted third parties or centralized authorities, if not a hodge podge of different proprietary software that is not interoperable. Using one decentralized database structure Arguably has some Advantages or the status quo. But of course switching costs can be difficult to overcomes especially at a global scale.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"644\" width=\"901\" data-init-width=\"987\" height=\"266\" data-init-height=\"291\" title=\"mrv\" src=\"https:\/\/www.unlockingclimatesolutions.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/mrv.png\" data-width=\"901\" data-height=\"266\" style=\"aspect-ratio: auto 987 \/ 291;\" loading=\"lazy\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>A Number Of Protocols Are Building Smart Contracts That Use Satellite Data To Automatically Dispense Rewards To People Who Successfully Regenerate Bodies Of Land By Increasing Tree Cover, Improving Soil, And More.
